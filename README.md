# [Data Wrangling](#Table-Of-Contents)
The wrangling was done on the master file I use to clean their data, the title you should look for is Afiliaciones there I clean the data, to see the entire document and more in detail comments I added [click](https://github.com/JorgePablol/Audience-and-Affiliations-Tableau-PLibMx/blob/main/Libertarian_cleaning.ipynb) if the document don't open reload or download and open it with Google Colab.

## Cleaning And Saving
**Trying to skip some code lines after realizing this was going to be repetitive.**

**In the future I should convert this entire code into a function and also add more regex. Anyway I was kind of burned out at that time to think on a better solution, this worked and cleaned the entire dataset, and also it can work as a script.**
